## How to Use this Wiki

TODO: Create example code repository and put it here

This wiki contains pages that are best read in order. Many of the articles, especially at the beginning, suggest other articles sensible to continue with. Most pages will contain code snippets, with full examples planned to be provided in example mods. (This is not done yet)

Additionally, you might account lines prefixed with `TODO:`. Those are notes for people working on the wiki what still needs to be done. For now, you can ignore them. Just know that there is more content to be inserted there.

TODO: Give an outline of all of the wiki articles once they're ready

## How to Learn Modding, for Beginners

Minecraft modding can get complicated. We aim to provide a resource to help you learn
fundamental modding concepts. However, there are some things that we can't do and
expect you to learn on your own.

Asking questions properly, whether it is on our forum or on Discord, is an essential
skill to have. Never be afraid to ask questions, we're always willing to help, and we
don't judge.

TODO: Methodology for asking questions here

Many problems have been solved in modding before, and are publicly available for you
to see and use as most mods for Quilt are open source. We recommend that you look at
examples of how to do things in open source repositories and sometimes "steal" code.
Open source repositories are there for you to learn from and use, don't be afraid of
them!
